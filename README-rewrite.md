### Terminal Bot

this bot allows you to do things no person should be able to do. run terminal commands directly on your host.

i strongly reccomend running this in a vm for your own saftey. i have also not tested this on windows, but i doubt it'd work.
does stdout/stderr even exist on windows?

anyway, the only dependency is discord.js, which you can get by running `npm install discord.js` with sudo perms, and run the bot with `node index.js`
